## About

A clothing store website for admins, made for managing your products, categories, and even admins. With modern technologies,
like Bootstrap and PHP, the website has a modern, and beautiful design, followed by amazing functionalities, meeting all the
needs for managing a clothes stock.
This website was made as an academic project at [SENAC Santo Amaro](https://www.sp.senac.br/), SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil.

## Installation

To install the project, use git clone:

```bash
git clone  git@github.com:brunovicenters/Charlie-PI.git
```

For running the website, you'll need some PHP server, and a database connection. We used (and recommend you to use) Xampp as a server.
We've created an example file for connecting to the database. Create another file called "conexao.php" in the same directory ("conexao"),
and use the code from the example to connect to your database.

## Structure

The connection example file is at the "conexao" directory. All the pages are at the "src" directory, that is divided in the following way:

- **admin** - It contains the full CRUD for the admins.
- **assets** - It contains all the images and css used in the project.
- **categoria** - It contains the full CRUD for the categories.
- **home** - It contains the home page.
- **login** - It contains the login pages.
- **produtos** - It contains the full CRUD for the products + the file to add more images to already existing products.
- **scripts** - It contains all the scripts that were used in the project.
- **templates** - It contains all the templates and components used in the project.

## Assets

The design and logo were made by our group, and others classmates.
