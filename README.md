## About

A clothing store website for admins, made for managing your products, categories, and even admins. With modern technologies,
like Bootstrap and PHP, the website has a modern, and beautiful design, followed by amazing functionalities, meeting all the
needs for managing a clothes stock.
This website was made as an academic project at [SENAC Santo Amaro](https://www.sp.senac.br/), SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil.

## Installation

To install the project, use git clone:

```bash
git clone  git@github.com:brunovicenters/Charlie-PI.git
```

For running the website, you'll need some PHP server, and a database connection. We used (and recommend you to use) Xampp as a server.

## Assets

The design and logo were made by our group, and others classmates.

Pictures from Carousel were gotten from:
